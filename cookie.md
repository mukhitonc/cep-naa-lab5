Ingredients
3 cups all-purpose unbleached flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Zest of a lemon
1/4 cup canola oil
3/4 cup maple sugar
3/4 cup maple butter
3 tablespoons maple syrup (preferably dark syrup for its robust flavour)
2 egg whites
2 ripe bananas, mashed with a fork
 
Method
Preheat the oven to 180 °C (350 °F).
In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and lemon zest.
In another bowl, use an electric mixer to cream the canola oil with the maple sugar, maple butter and maple syrup.
Add the egg whites and beat until smooth and uniform.
Gradually add the dry ingredients and banana, folding in with a wooden spoon.
Spoon out 30 ml (2 tablespoons) portions of dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving 5 cm (2 in) of space between each.
Bake in the oven, one sheet at a time, for about 10 minutes or until the bottom of the cookies has browned.
