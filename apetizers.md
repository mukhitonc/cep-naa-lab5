Ingredients
8 tbsp maple syrup (preferably amber syrup for its rich flavour)
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 quarter of a watermelon, cut into cubes of about 2.5 cm (1 in.)
1 block Halloumi cheese, about 160 g (1/3 lb), cut into cubes of about 2.5 cm (1 in.)
8 fresh basil leaves, finely chopped
 
Method
Soak 4 â€“ 8 (depending on their length) bamboo skewers in water.
Combine maple syrup, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar in a large bowl.
Place watermelon and halloumi cubes into the marinade and toss gently to coat well. Let marinate for 5 minutes.
Preheat barbecue to medium. Oil the grill.
Thread the skewers, alternating watermelon and halloumi cubes. Keep the marinade.
Grill the brochettes for 8 minutes, turning every 2 minutes to colour all 4 sides. Remove from barbecue. Brush with marinade and sprinkle with basil. Serve.
